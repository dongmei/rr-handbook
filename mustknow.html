                <h2 class="section-title">Being Ectothermic</h2>

                <p>Reptiles are ectothermic, or cold blooded. Do you know what are the advantages and disadvantages of being cold blooded?</p>

                <div  class="subsection">
                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Advantages</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Need to eat regularly. Reptiles have a low metabolic rate because they do not have to continuously burn fuel to maintain body temperature. Can have one big meal and then go without food for weeks, even months depending on the size of the meal. Some reptiles, like lizards and crocodilians, are able to store food in their tail to be used up slowly</li>

                        <li>Rely on food only for growth, maintenance and reproduction. They can survive on a fraction of the food that would be required by a mammal or bird of similar body weight. This enables reptiles to survive in harsh environments</li>

                        <li>Reptiles living in hot areas are often active at night and seek shelter during the day. This reduces the risk of predation by daytime hunters like birds of prey</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Disadvantages</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because of their low metabolic rate, reptiles tend to “burn out” quickly. They are capable of only short bursts of energy, after which they must rest to replenish their oxygen</li>

                        <li>Warm-blooded animals are able to sustain work over longer period of exertion</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Crocodilians</h2>

                <p>Crocodilians have roamed the Earth for over 200 million years. They are more closely related to dinosaurs than other living creatures on Earth.Altogether there are 23 species of crocodilians, grouped into 3 families, found in North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia.There are 14 species of Crocodylidae, 8 species of Alligatoridae (Alligators and Caimans) and only 1 specie of Gavialidae". Saltwater or Indopacific crocodile is not only the largest crocodilian but also the largest of all reptiles.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Winning Design</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Body structure designed for survival, not changed for last 200 million years.</li>

                        <li>Have an elongated snout</li>

                        <li>Eyes and nostrils set on top to allow them to have a good view above water, and breathe while body remains submerged</li>

                        <li>Without being seen, they are able to ambush prey with a high success rate</li>

                        <li>Able to open their mouth to snap at prey and prevent water from entering their windpipe at the same time. Done by closing a flap of cartilaginous flap (palatal valve) at the back of the throat</li>

                        <li>Openings of nostrils and ears can be shut when underwater</li>

                        <li>Apart from 2 movable eyelids, a 3rd transparent eyelid (nictitating membrane) helps to cover their eyes while underwater</li>

                        <li>Long, muscular tail provides power to push forward when swimming</li>

                        <li>‘Tail walk’ – using powerful tail as a support to leap out of water to snatch birds</li>

                        <li>Crocodilian movements include: swim, belly crawl, high walk, jump and gallop</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Most caring parents among reptiles</li>

                        <li>Mother crocodilians lay a clutch of 35 – 40 eggs each breeding season and guard their nests fiercely throughout incubation period of about 3 months</li>

                        <li>After eggs hatch, remain with hatchlings for few weeks to few years (depending on species)</li>

                        <li>Female Nile crocodiles use their teeth to crack unhatched eggs in order to free hatchlings within. Hatchlings remain with both parents for several weeks, using their backs as platforms for basking</li>

                        <li>Female American alligator look after its young for up to 4 years! It is longest period of parental care for any crocodilians</li>

                        <li>On average, at least 80% of eggs die during incubation and about 1% of hatchlings reach maturity as they fall prey to birds, fish and other adult crocodilians.</li>

                        <li>For crocodiles, intermediate temperatures produce males, low and high temperatures produce female hatchlings</li>

                        <li>Temperature of nest usually varies at different points, a mixture of male and female hatchlings are more common</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Interesting Facts About Crocodilians</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most crocodilians can stay underwater for over an hour. The record holder was an American alligator, which remained underwater for 6 hours and 5mins during an experiment conducted in 1925</li>

                        <li>‘Crocodile’ comes from the Greek word ‘krokodeilos’, which means lizard</li>

                        <li>Crocodilians can snap their jaws with extreme force but the muscles for opening them are very weak. With crocodiles measuring 2metres or less, all you need is a rubber band to keep their mouths shut</li>

                        <li>Crocodilians have the sharpest sense of hearing among reptiles, and they are the noisiest. American alligators produce the loudest bellows, which sound like a lion’s roar</li>

                        <li>Crocodilians cannot chew. For large prey, they usually hold the victims in water till they drown and then tear off chunks of flesh by spinning, twisting and rolling over repeatedly. Sometimes, they would let parts of a carcass to rot in water before consuming it but that does not mean theyprefer rotting flesh</li>
