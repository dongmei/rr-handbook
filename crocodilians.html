                        <p>Crocodilians have roamed the Earth for over 200 million years. They are more closely related to dinosaurs than other living creatures on Earth.Altogether there are 23 species of crocodilians, grouped into 3 families, found in North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia.There are 14 species of Crocodylidae, 8 species of Alligatoridae (Alligators and Caimans) and only 1 specie of Gavialidae". Saltwater or Indopacific crocodile is not only the largest crocodilian but also the largest of all reptiles.</p>

                                    <li>Female Nile crocodiles use their teeth to crack unhatched eggs in order to free hatchlings within. Hatchlings remain with both parents for several weeks, using their backs as platforms for basking</li>

                                    <li>Female American alligator look after its young for up to 4 years! It is longest period of parental care for any crocodilians</li>

                                    <li>On average, at least 80% of eggs die during incubation and about 1% of hatchlings reach maturity as they fall prey to birds, fish and other adult crocodilians.</li>

                                        <li>Most crocodilians can stay underwater for over an hour. The record holder was an American alligator, which remained underwater for 6 hours and 5mins during an experiment conducted in 1925</li>

                                        <li>‘Crocodile’ comes from the Greek word ‘krokodeilos’, which means lizard</li>

                                        <li>Crocodilians can snap their jaws with extreme force but the muscles for opening them are very weak. With crocodiles measuring 2metres or less, all you need is a rubber band to keep their mouths shut</li>

                                        <li>Crocodilians have the sharpest sense of hearing among reptiles, and they are the noisiest. American alligators produce the loudest bellows, which sound like a lion’s roar</li>

                                        <li>Crocodilians cannot chew. For large prey, they usually hold the victims in water till they drown and then tear off chunks of flesh by spinning, twisting and rolling over repeatedly. Sometimes, they would let parts of a carcass to rot in water before consuming it but that does not mean theyprefer rotting flesh</li>

                                    <p>By preying on weak, sickly and old animals, crocodilians help to keep prey populations healthy and maintain the balance of the ecosystem. However, they are both predators and prey of humans. Between 1950s – 1960s, crocodilians were killed in huge numbers for their skin (about 100 million hides were sold).</p>

                                    <p>Many crocodilians species are critically endangered due to excessive hunting. Pollution, drowning in fishing nets and destruction of mangrove forests are also threats to their continued existence. Crocodile farms that harvest the crocodilians for meat and hides, combined with effective wildlife-protection efforts can take hunting pressure off wild populations. </p>
