                    <p>Reptile Realm (RR) seeks to change the misconceptions of the public with regards to reptiles and their role in the ecosystem. The station showcases the beautiful reptiles of the world. Learn about the amazing adaptations and secretive behaviors of snakes, lizards, crocodilians and testudines (turtles, terrapins and tortoise).
                    We are located opposite the King Cobra exhibit at the Reptile Garden.</p>
                    <p>Reptiles are vertebrates (animals with backbones) and have dry horny scales as their body covering. They are cold-blooded, hence they are dependent on external sources of heat like the sunâ€™s rays for maintaining their body temperature (ectothermic). Reptiles reproduce either by laying eggs on land or bearing their young alive. They can be divided into 4 diverse groups.</p>
