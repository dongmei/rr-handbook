        <p>Encased in a shell, testudines are so distinct that no one can mistake them for another group of animals. They are considered the most ancient of the living reptiles. Fossil records show that testudines appeared on earth over 200 million years ago, before crocodiles, lizards, snakes and mammals.</p>

                            <li>Turtles store fat in their shells. Most museums prefer not to exhibit very large turtles because they can drip oil for up to 50 years.</li>
                            <li>Some turtles breathe through their butts. The Fitzroy River turtle and a few other turtle species. They have a pair of sacs near their cloaca (an opening in some animals for mating and excreting waste). Water is drawn into the cloaca and the oxygen in its is absorbed through the sacs before it is expelled.</li>
                            <li>As a turtle grows, its scutes enlarge. New layers of keratin aredeposited and they form growth rings on the scutes. However, it is not possible to tell the age of a tortoise accurately by counting the number of growth rings because growth layers may wear off with age and some have more than one growth period in a year.</li>
                            <li>GIn the old days, sailors captured giant tortoises by the thousands,stored them on board their ships and slaughtered them as and when needed. Docile and able to survive without food for long periods, giant tortoises became a convenient source of fresh meat on long voyages.</li>
                            <li>Fortunately, both Galapagos and Aldabra giant tortoises gained protection and they are now thriving in numbers.</li>

	                	<p>ALL turtles face many life-threatening obstacles to their survival in every stage of their lives</p>
	                    <h5>Habitat loss & urbanisation</h5>
	                    <div>
	                        <p>Habitat can be destroyed or degraded in 2 basic ways:</p>
	                        <ol>
	                            <li>Quantitative loss: reduction in the amount of habitat area</li>
	                            <li>Qualitative loss: change or degradation in the structure function, or composition of the habitat</li>
	                        </ol> 
	                        <p>Sometimes it is a combination of quantitative and qualitative: eg, when a forest is fragmented or divided into many patches (to convert into agricultural or residential land):</p>
	                        <ol>
	                            <li>Artificial Lighting: Nesting turtles compete for the use of the beach. Lights from developments discourage females from nesting or may result in them making a “false crawl” whereby they come ashore to find that the beach is no longer suitable for laying eggs. Egg laying may be delayed or aborted. Hatchlings are often confused by the lights of buildings near the beach; become disoriented and wander inland, where they often die of dehydration, predation or get run over by vehicles.</li>
	                            <li>Coastal Armouring: Sea walls, rock revetments and sandbags installed in an attempt to protect beachfront property from erosion often block female turtles from reaching suitable nesting habitat and accelerate erosion down the beach</li>
	                            <li>Beach Nourishment: Pumping, trucking or depositing sand on a beach to replace what has been eroded can negatively impact sea turtles if the sand is too compacted for nesting; or drastically different from native beach behaviour sediments - affecting nest-site selection, digging behaviour, incubation temperature and the moisture content of nests. Renourishment during nesting season can also result in nests buried far beneath the surface or destroyed by heavy machinery</li>
	                        </ol> 
	                        
	                        <h5>Pollution</h5>
	                        <ol>
	                            <li>Ingestion of debris: - PLASTIC: Many sea turtles mistake floating semi-transparent bags for jellyfish and eat them. They die from choking or from being unable to feed</li>
	                            <li>Oil & Gas Exploration: Oil spills and the presence of tar in the water. Oil on the skin and shell of a marine turtle can affect respiration and salt gland functions, as well as the turtle’s blood chemistry. The ingestion of tar pellets is also a major concern</li>
	                            <li>FFibropapilloma Tumors: lobe-shaped tumors that infect all soft portions of a turtle’s body. Grow primarily on the skin, but can also appear between scales and scutes, in the mouth, on the eyes, and on internal organs. Tumors increase in size and number until the turtle is seriously debilitated and usually die</li>
	                            <li>Pollution also kills aquatic plant and animal life, the food source of sea turtles</li>
	                        </ol> 
	                        <h5>Over exploitation</h5>
	                        <ol>
	                            <li>Poaching of sea turtles for flesh, shell and flippers</li>
	                            <li>Over-harvesting of sea turtle eggs for economic gains</li>
	                            <li>Over-kill of freshwater turtles for sale as luxury food item</li>
	                        </ol> 
	                        <h5>Irresponsible fishing</h5>
	                        <ol>
	                            <li>Fishing practices that kill sea turtles are the major cause for the decline in sea turtlepopulations. Shrimp trawlers without Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) – equipment that allows sea turtles to escape, but retains the needed catch – and gill nets and longlines trap, entangle and drown sea turtles</li>
	                            <li>Today, all U.S. shrimpers are required to put Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in their nets but not all fisherman comply with the law</li>
	                        </ol> 
	                        <h5>Pet trade</h5>
	                        <ol>
	                            <li>Rare and unusual species are traded internationally in large numbers and prices aredirectly related to the rarity of a species. Traders send agents to remote source areas to purchase rare turtles from the local villagers. This depletes not only target species, but also other chelonian species as the locals often cannot tell the turtles species apart. Trade often continues until the source area has been vacuumed of its turtles</li>
	                            <li>Captive breeding is less attractive economically because of ‘four-inch-rules’ imposed by the United States, Canada and some European Union countries. These regulations make the import of hatchlings or juveniles under 10 cm shell length illegal, forcing the pet trade to deal in larger, wild-collected animals</li>
