        <p>Nearly 3500 species of snakes, only 10% are venomous. Snakes can be found almost everywhere except Antarctica, New Zealand and Ireland. There are more than 245 species found in Asia. They can be characterized by their long, slim and flexible body. Snakes are lack of limbs, eyelids and external ear, but they do have backbones albeit their flexibility, most have more than 200 vertebrae in their body openings.</p>

                            <li><b>Basic backward pointing teeth</b> (Aglyphous snakes): all snakes have them. All boas andpythons have these teeth</li>
                            <li><b>Fixed, front fangs</b> (Proteroglyphous snakes): Elapides like the cobras and mambas have these teeth. Typically bite, hold and chew to inject venom</li>
                            <li><b>Fixed rear fangs</b> (Opisthoglyphous snakes): Large and mostly grooved. Venom is injected into the prey as it is swallowed. Most rear fanged snakes are mildly venomous except for Boomslang</li>
                            <li><b>Long, hinged foldable fangs</b> (Solenoglyphous snakes): Vipers, rattlesnakes and adders belong to this group. Folded down against roof of mouth when not in used. Snakes with these fangs typically strike, envenomate and release the prey but those which prey on small animals will bite and hold onto prey</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A few snakes do not conform to these categories. A group of African venomous snakes which includes burrowing vipers, asps and mole vipers are solenoglyphous but the fangs swing out sideways, allowing it to strike without opening its mouth, perhaps allowing it to hunt in small tunnels.</p>
