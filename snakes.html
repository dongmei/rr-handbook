        <p>Nearly 3500 species of snakes, only 10% are venomous. Snakes can be found almost everywhere except Antarctica, New Zealand and Ireland. There are more than 245 species found in Asia. They can be characterized by their long, slim and flexible body. Snakes are lack of limbs, eyelids and external ear, but they do have backbones albeit their flexibility, most have more than 200 vertebrae in their body openings.</p>
