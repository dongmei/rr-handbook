        <p>Lizards is the most successful group of all reptiles (almost 6000 species). They are making up about 60% of all reptilian species, and can be found everywhere in the world, except Arctic and Antarctic. Lizards typically have limbs and external ears. They also have 4 legs: some are large and powerful e.g. Iguana, while others are short and almost redundant.</p>
