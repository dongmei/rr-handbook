        <p>Lizards is the most successful group of all reptiles (almost 6000 species). They are making up about 60% of all reptilian species, and can be found everywhere in the world, except Arctic and Antarctic. Lizards typically have limbs and external ears. They also have 4 legs: some are large and powerful e.g. Iguana, while others are short and almost redundant.</p>

                        <p>Komodo dragon are the largest living lizards in the world,. They are related to dinosaurs and ancestors are believed to have roamed Earth more than 300million years ago. It is difficult to tell male and female apart as they look similar – different scale patterns around genital opening unreliable. X-ray, endoscopy and DNA analysis are better methods.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Size: up to 3.1m in length and 116kg in weight</li>
                                <li>Life span: over 50 years</li>
                            </ul> 
                        
                        <h5>Habitat and range:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Exclusively in Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Padar, Flores and Gili Motang</li>
                            <li>Dry grasslands and hilly terrain of these islands</li>
                        </ul> 

                        <h5>Diet:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Able to grow to a gigantic size due to voracious appetite</li>
                            <li>Can consume up to 80% of body weight in a single meal, equivalent to a 20kg child taking 16kg of food at one go</li>
                            <li>Throat and jaw muscles adapted to swallow huge chunks of meat quickly</li>
                            <li>Sharp teeth great for tearing flesh, and can have up to 4-5 sets of teeth in a lifetime</li>
                            ,<li>Feeds on wild buffaloes, deer, goats, snakes and carcasses. Snacks on eggs, snakes, birds, rodents, fish, small lizards including baby komodo dragons</li>
                        </ul> 

                        <h5>Shrewd hunters:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flicks its long, forked tongue out constantly to ‘smell’ the air and locate potential prey or dead animals</li>
                            <li>Hunts by waiting motionless along a trail and ambushing unsuspecting prey</li>
                            <li>Able to sniff out food 11km away. Once a kill is made, all will join in to feast and fight over the best chunks of meat.</li>
                            <li>Can see objects as far as 300m away</li>
                            <li>Saliva contains at least 200 (?) different strains of bacteria. Once prey is bitten, unlikely to survive even if managed to escape as infection of wound caused by bacteria in the saliva.</li>
                            <li>Bacteria in saliva affect other animals only, komodo dragons immune to each other’s bite</li>
                            <li>Recent research into the feeding behaviour of the Komodo dragon has shown that it is actually venomous, possessing complex venom glands in its jaw, which excrete a variety of toxic substances that prevent blood clotting and lower blood pressure in its prey</li>
                        </ul> 

                        <h5>Komodo dragons at Singapore Zoo:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On 15 Nov 2009, we welcomed the arrival of the first Komodo dragon hatchling in 34 years. The first zoo in Asia to breed them successful outside their native home in Indonesia</li>
                            <li>After 1 and half years of courtship, Yoko and Bima mated and a clutch of eggs was laid. In the wild, clutch size of 30 eggs are typical, and incubation period of 9 months</li>
                            <li>Yoko’s eggs were incubated artificially, 1 egg hatched successfully and the young was introduced into the exhibit in August 2010</li>
                            <li>More recently, a second successful hatchling on 1 June 2011</li>
                            <li>Vacuum assisted therapy (used for humans to heal chronic wounds) was used to heal Yoko’s wound sustained while laying eggs in a burrow</li>
                            <li>Unlike adults, baby komodo dragons are spotted (yellow speckles) and are agile climbers</li>
                        </ul> 

                        <h5>Conservation:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>IUCN status – Vulnerable. Fewer than 5,000 komodo dragons left in their native habitat</li>
                            <li>Regarded as one of Indonesia’s national treasures, can only be given away by the President</li>
                            <li>Increasing human population especially on Flores Island causing decline. Habitats being converted into villages and farms, also due to competition for food sources with villagers.</li>
                            <li>Fortunately, they are protected by the Indonesiangovernment.</li>
                            ,<li>By breeding them, Singapore Zoo helps to ensure the future survival of the species</li>
                        </ul>
