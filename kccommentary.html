                <p>Below is the recommended process to ensure a smooth experience during the commentary:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Check the condition of king cobra</strong> before you start your duty whether the snake is shedding. Usually a signage will be put up if the feeding is cancelled.</li>
                    <li><b>Check with keepers</b> before the start of commentary (recommended 15 minutes in advance) on the meal prepared for king cobra.</li>
                    <li><b>Introduce yourself</b> and tell visitors that you are about to do a commentary about the king cobra</li>
                    <li><b>Introduce watching guidelines</b> to visitors:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep behind the rope barrier;</li>
                            <li>Get the visitors in the front to squat or sit down so that the ones at the back can see;</li>
                            <li>Do not knock glass, touch glass, wave things in front of snake. as this will agitate them and distract them from eating, and snakes may also strike glass and hurt themselves;</li>
                            <li>Do not use flash photography;
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Remember your body language</b>. Do not to gesture too vigorously, and do not pace up and down during the commentary</li>
                </ol>

                        <h5>Details about the snake in exhibit</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our king cobra is named "James".</li>
                            <li>It comes from Maylasia.</li>
                        </ul> 

                        <h5>Maximum length</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Usually about 3m. Currently longest known venomous snake in the world, can grow up to almost 6m.</li>
                            <li>James is about 3 meters long.</li>
                        </ul> 

                        <h5>Where can they be found?</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Distributed across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia", includes India, east to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, southern China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</li>
                            <li>LColoration varies from country to country, NOT habitat.</li>
                        </ul> 

                        <h5>What do they eat?</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Other snakes and occasionally monitor lizards</li>
                            <li>Snakes that we use to feed them with are from a supplier in Malaysia</li>
                        </ul> 
                        <h5>Why are the snakes killed before feeding?</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To prevent prey from biting/injuring the Kings.</li>
                            <li>Less traumatizing for visitors</li>
                            <li>Parasites on live snakes can jump onto the KC and treating them can be dangerous for the keepers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>How often are the snakes fed?</h5>
                            <li>Once a week, every Sunday</li>
                            <li>Snakes, being cold-blooded, do not need to burn food to maintain body temperature unlike mammals</li>
                        </h5>
                        <h5>How do snakes regulate their body temperature?</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diurnal snakes (active during the day) usually bask in the sun to warm themselves up in the beginning of the day. When the temperature gets too high, they move into the shade.</li>
                            <li>Nocturnal snakes (active at night) bask on warm flat rocks, warm sand or even warm surfaced roads as they start their day.</li>
                            <li>Snakes that inhabit the colder regions are often diurnal and go into a state of hibernation when the temperature starts to drop. They are also usually darker in colour to absorb more heat.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Are the King cobra’s immune to each other’s venom?</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Previously thought to be immune to venom of other King Cobras</li>
                            <li>But a recent study has shown that a female KC was severely bitten and injected with the King cobra’s immune to each other’s venom? venom by another KC, and eventually died</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>If the King cobras start to eat, you may explain:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The chewing action is to inject venom into the prey.</li>
                            <li>The prey is waved to stimulate the King Cobras to take the prey</li>
                            <li>Prey is always swallowed headfirst so that their limbs fall back nicely but for snakes, it makes no difference</li>
                            <li>Huge amount of saliva is produced to lubricate the prey as it moves down the gullet and elastic skin stretched to accommodate extra volume.</li> 
                            <li>Lower jaw of snake formed in such a way that it can move forward or backward (explain jaw walk</li>
                            <li>Together with flexible skin, this allows snake to unhinge its jaw and widen the mouth cavity to swallow prey larger than its head</li>
                            <li>Look out for the trachea tube and draw attention to its purpose</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>What if the King Cobra doesn’t eat?</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain possible reasons e.g. shedding, distracted by visitors</li>
                            <li>It might eat later when there are less people or when people stop knocking the glass or waving things at the snakes</li>
                            <li>Or the snake might be full</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Conservation message (must be added towards end of commentary)</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Snakes play a major role in control of rodent population. This is more so in countries like India and Thailand</li>
                            <li>In Thailand, snakes have actually been introduced to the padi fields to help control the rats from damaging the rice crop</li>
                            <li>Although King cobras are not endangered at the moment, they are killed for their skin and traditional medicine. Their blood and gall bladder are said to have medicinal properties</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Other topics to cover during the commentary if time permits:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Defense:</b> In response to threats, when unable to escape, the king cobra gives a dramatic display, in which the front third of the body is lifted off the ground, reaching a height of up to 1.5 metres. The narrow hood is also erected, a growling hiss is produced, and downward strikes are made, although it rarely attempts to bite</li>
                            <li><b>Venom:</b> Type of venom - neurotoxins that attack the blood circulatory system. While the king cobra’s venom is not as toxic as that of some highly venomous species, the sheer volume produced in a single bite is enough to kill 20 to 30 adult humans or an elephant</li>
                            <li><b>Shedding</b></li>
                        </ul>
