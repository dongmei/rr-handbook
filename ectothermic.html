                    <li>Need to eat regularly. Reptiles have a low metabolic rate because they do not have to continuously burn fuel to maintain body temperature. Can have one big meal and then go without food for weeks, even months depending on the size of the meal. Some reptiles, like lizards and crocodilians, are able to store food in their tail to be used up slowly</li>

                    <li>Rely on food only for growth, maintenance and reproduction. They can survive on a fraction of the food that would be required by a mammal or bird of similar body weight. This enables reptiles to survive in harsh environments</li>

                    <li>Reptiles living in hot areas are often active at night and seek shelter during the day. This reduces the risk of predation by daytime hunters like birds of prey</li>

                    <li>Because of their low metabolic rate, reptiles tend to “burn out” quickly. They are capable of only short bursts of energy, after which they must rest to replenish their oxygen</li>
                    <li>Warm-blooded animals are able to sustain work over longer period of exertion</li>
